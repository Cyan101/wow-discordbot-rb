### Basic Discord bot with WoW integrated API tools

This bot is a major WIP and is mostly designed to be run for a personal server/guild, it could easily be modified to be hosted by one person for many discord servers/guilds but that's not my goal.

## Info
Version = 0.2

Ruby version 2.2+ required

## Install/Guide
```
gem install bundler
bundle
```

[Grab your Discordbot token ](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me)

Into a config.yaml file (see example below)
